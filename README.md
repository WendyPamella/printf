# 0x11. C - Printf

This project replicates the printf() function in C. It was done in collaboration with Njamba Gachoki as part of our learning curriculum at ALX.
This project was also meant to give us practical experience on effectively collaborating when handling projects.


## Prototype

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
## Usage 

1. The function produces output according to a format.
2. Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

### Examples of Usage

1. _printf("Hi, how are you\n")  This prints: __Hi, how are you__
2. _printf("I am %d years old", 25)  This prints __I am 25 years old__
